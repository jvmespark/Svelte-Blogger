So I just finished my freshman year and im here to break down the experience

# Course Work
---
Here are the CS classes I took in my first 2 semesters at college:  
### Data Structures
Generally regarded as the weedout hell class, but i beg to differ.  
I skipped CS1 (I still need to make up the credits later since I didn't pass through AP, but whatever) so I could specifically take this class during the fall because i heard that's when it's the most spicy  

### Computer Organization
I loved systems and low level programming before I went into this class so I already knew I was gonna have so much fun here.  
Learned a shit ton of assembly and linux

### Foundations of Computer Science
No idea why this class is named this when really its just a discrete math course with a sprinkle of computation theory, but atleast it has a cool acronym (fox)  
The first few weeks were the hardest, but once you get over the recursive objects and inductional proofs things (in my opinion) got way more interesting and easier to handle.  
Thats not to say the material got easier per-say, but rather my interest in the class got stronger.  
Why? because number theory and finite automata are cool as hell thats why

### other necessary classes I was forced to take :(  
Physics, Biology, Calc 1&2, AI and the Information Age  
My favorites here would be Biology and Physics

# Campus
---
It got frosty here during january, like -10 degrees faranheit  
I knew upstate new york got a bit crazy, but that was insane  
Atleast it was dry, there was no snow or rain  
In terms of dorming I lived at E-Complex, where if you're a socially distant person who likes to peace and quiet like myself, it was perfect. Since it's one of the closest to the academic buildings, I could go out and bring back a new book from the library late at night if needed without a long walk.   

# Books I've read
---
Talking about the Folsom Library, i have to say its one of my favorite places here.  
Its so expansive and theres no much books that I want to read there.  
Although I'm not a huge fan of it's brutalist architecture (I wish it was more gothic), but i digress  
Here's a list of books I've read freshman year that I recommend:  

# What I've accomplished
---
Projects ive worked on  
technologies ive learned  
skills ive gathered  
foundations ive built  

# What I've learned
---
Nothing every lasts forever  
How to take a moment to breathe  
I've learned peace and how to take things slowly  
I've learned my strength and intelligence  

# Funny Stories
--- 
Of course there's no better way to wrap up a post than with some funny stories from my time.  

# What's next?
---
Well, I've still got 3 more years of undergrad so my academic career is still in full motion  
This summer I'll have to study for intro to algorithms and build more software  
I hope to give an attempt at a startup, maybe i'll learn something interesting from the experience
